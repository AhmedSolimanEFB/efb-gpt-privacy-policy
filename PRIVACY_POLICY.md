We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and protected when using our Custom GPT integrated with the ClickUp API (‚ÄúClickAPI‚Äù).

## 1. Information We Collect
When you interact with ClickAPI, we may process the following information:

- **User Input:** Any text you type into the chatbot, including queries about tasks, projects, or users in ClickUp.  
- **ClickUp Data:** Task details, list names, project metadata, and user assignment data retrieved from the ClickUp API via our secure proxy.  
- **System Metadata:** Non-identifiable technical information (IP address, browser type, time of request).  

We **do not collect or store sensitive personal data** such as passwords, payment details, or private documents unless you explicitly provide them in queries (not recommended).

---

## 2. How We Use Information
The data we process is used solely for:

- Retrieving information from ClickUp to answer your queries.  
- Displaying summaries, task counts, and project insights.  
- Improving the functionality and performance of the chatbot.  
- Ensuring system security, monitoring for abuse, and debugging errors.  

We do not use the data for advertising or profiling.

---

## 3. Data Sharing
We do **not sell or rent** your information to third parties.  

We may share limited information only with:
- **ClickUp API:** to retrieve project and task data as requested.  
- **OpenAI API:** to generate responses based on the data you request.  

Both services process only the information necessary to provide chatbot responses.

---

## 4. Data Storage & Retention
- User queries and API responses may be **temporarily cached** for performance but are not stored permanently.  
- We do not create independent databases of user conversations.  
- Any logs retained for debugging are stored securely and deleted within [X days].  

---

## 5. Data Security
We apply industry-standard security measures:
- Encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS).  
- Access restricted to authorized personnel only.  
- No direct exposure of ClickUp API tokens (requests pass through a secured proxy).  

However, no method of transmission is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.

## 6. Your Rights
You have the right to:
- Request deletion of any personal data we may have stored.  
- Ask for clarification about how your data is handled.  
- Opt out of using the service at any time.

- **ClickUp API** (task and project management data).  
- **OpenAI API** (AI-generated responses).  
- **GitHub Pages** (hosting this Privacy Policy).  

These services have their own privacy policies, which apply in addition to this one.
